## Phase 2 Data Science Project – Moringa School

This project analyzes movie industry data to guide a production company in identifying the most profitable and popular genres and features, by examining and visualizing data from various sources, we offer evidence based on the  recommendations for future movie investment



##  Business Understanding

The production company aims to fund movies that are successful both with critics and at the box office.
The main business being, which movie genres and features should the company prioritize to earn more profit and attract more viewers?



##  Data Sources

We used multiple datasets, including
- `tn_movie` – Theatrical movie budgets and revenues
- `imdb_data.db` – Data on movie ratings, genres
- Merged and cleaned data for analysis



##  Data Preparation

We performed:
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, data types, etc.)
- Merging datasets
- Feature engineering
- Removal of duplicates and outliers



## Data Analysis & Visualization

We used
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualizations: bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots
- Correlation analysis

Tools
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau for dashboard visualizations



##  Findings

- Genres like Action, Adventure, and Drama usually have a higher Retuen On Investment

- Movies with high ratings often get more viewers, considering they have low Production Budget

- The year a movie is released and how much it costs to make can affect the profit it makes



##  Business Recommendations

- Focusing on producing geners like Action and Drama movies

-Choose well-rated stories with average spending

- Pay attention to release timing and the audience rating
