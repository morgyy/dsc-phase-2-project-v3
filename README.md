## Phase 2 Data Science Project – Moringa School

This project explores movie industry data to help a production company decide which genres and attributes are most profitable and popular. By analyzing and visualizing data from multiple sources, we provide data-driven recommendations for future movie investments.

---

##  Business Understanding

The production company wants to invest in movies that perform well both critically and commercially. The business question is:

**“Which genres and features of movies should the company focus on to maximize profitability and audience engagement?”**

##  Data Sources

We used multiple datasets, including:
- `tn_movie_budgets.csv` – Theatrical movie budgets and revenues
- `IMDb_data.db` – Data on movie ratings, genres, and other metadata
- Merged and cleaned data for analysis

---

##  Data Preparation

We performed:
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, data types, etc.)
- Merging datasets
- Feature engineering
- Removal of duplicates and outliers

---

## Data Analysis & Visualization

Techniques used:
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualizations: bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots
- Correlation analysis

Tools:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau for dashboard visualizations
